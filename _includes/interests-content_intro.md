I like working on projects that involve:
- **◈** respecting the **structure and geometry** of problems (e.g., invariances in theory/algorithms; structured sparsity for efficiency)  
- **△** investigating **minimal setups** that still capture key large-scale effects  
- **⇆** bringing **theory closer to practice**, with the aim of better understanding, informing, or improving the latter
